# Headache Journal

App I am making for myself to track my headaches.

# TODO

- For all DB actions, add a success/error indicator to avoid code crashes
- Centralize all styles
- Add a stats page that has following:
    - Total number of recorded headaches (from start date)
    - Avg headaches/month
    - Total advil
    - Avg advil taken per headache
    - Avg advil taken per month
    - Total icepacks
    - Avg ice packs per month
    - Avg ice pack per headache
    -
